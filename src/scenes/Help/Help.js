      You mean while I&apos;m sleeping in it? You don&apos;t know how to do any of those. Ah,
      computer dating. It&apos;s like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase &quot;upside
      your head.&quot; Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Oh yeah, good luck with that.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you killed your grandfather, you&apos;d cease to exist! You know, I was God
      once. Bender, being God isn&apos;t easy.

        If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope.

      <em> You have to use a light touch.</em>

Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.

      I meant &apos;physically&apos;. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could
      clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you?
    </h2>
    <p>
      For example, if you killed your grandfather, you&apos;d cease to exist! Ow, my spirit! Bender,
      this is Fry&apos;s decision&mldr; and he made it wrong. So it&apos;s time for us to interfere
      in his life. THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO
      RAISEN!
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Yeah, lots of people did.</li>
      <li>I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.</li>

      Good man. Nixon&apos;s pro-war and pro-family. Also Zoidberg. You mean while I&apos;m sleeping
      in it? Aww, it&apos;s true. I&apos;ve been hiding it for so long. Say what?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people
        won&apos;t be sure you&apos;ve done anything at all.
      </li>
      <li>Isn&apos;t it true that you have been paid for your testimony?</li>
      <li>Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You&apos;d think it would be
      something you&apos;d have to freebase. And from now on you&apos;re all named Bender Jr. You
      know, I was God once. How much did you make me?
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Fry, it&apos;s been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your
      species: fatal or non-fatal? Hello, little man. I will destroy you! Check it out, y&apos;all.
      Everyone who was invited is here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hey, what kinda party is this? There&apos;s no booze and only one hooker. That&apos;s not soon
      enough! WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?!
      &apos;It is!&apos; My precious torso!
    </p>
    <p>
      I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends
      all about him. No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don&apos;t own! Doomsday
      device? Ah, now the ball&apos;s in Farnsworth&apos;s court!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh sure! Blame the wizards! Ask her how her day was. Oh, I always feared he might run off like
      this. Why, why, why didn&apos;t I break his legs? Hey, what kinda party is this? There&apos;s
      no booze and only one hooker.
    </p>
    <p>
      This opera&apos;s as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can&apos;t just
      have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry! Bender, this is
      Fry&apos;s decision&mldr; and he made it wrong. So it&apos;s time for us to interfere in his
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! In our darkest hour, we can stand erect,
      with proud upthrust bosoms. I found what I need. And it&apos;s not friends, it&apos;s things.
      Meh. Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      You&apos;re going back for the Countess, aren&apos;t you? No! The cat shelter&apos;s on to me.
      We can&apos;t compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! And
      yet you haven&apos;t said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you?
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh sure! Blame the wizards! All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a
      suit&mldr; that&apos;s why I&apos;m transferring to business school! Daylight and everything.
      Is today&apos;s hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bite my shiny metal ass. I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc
      Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh&mldr; also, comes with double prize money. Have you ever
      tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?
    </p>
    <p>
      I&apos;m sure those windmills will keep them cool. It may comfort you to know that Fry&apos;s
      death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen
      years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.
