      Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There&apos;s only one reasonable course of
      action now: kill Flexo!
    </h2>
    <p>
      Kif might! Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? And when we woke up, we had these bodies.
      Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting
      them? Bender, you risked your life to save me!
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Well I&apos;da done better, but it&apos;s plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for
        that there incompetence.
      </strong>
      <em> Bender, this is Fry&apos;s decision&mldr; and he made it wrong.</em>
      So it&apos;s time for us to interfere in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      There&apos;s one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its
      brain! Hey, whatcha watching? Morbo will now introduce tonight&apos;s candidates&mldr; PUNY
      HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo&apos;s good friend, Richard Nixon.
    </p>
    <ol>

        In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from
        perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.
      </li>
      <li>There&apos;s no part of that sentence I didn&apos;t like!</li>
      <li>I can explain. It&apos;s very valuable.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Your best is an idiot!</h3>
    <p>
      No, just a regular mistake. Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Leela,
      are you alright? You got wanged on the head. So I really am important? How I feel when
      I&apos;m drunk is correct? Ok, we&apos;ll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then
      we&apos;ll go ride the bumper cars.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>No! The cat shelter&apos;s on to me.</li>
      <li>
        Dear God, they&apos;ll be killed on our doorstep! And there&apos;s no trash pickup until
        January 3rd.
      </li>
      <li>And yet you haven&apos;t said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Bender, quit destroying the universe! But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. I
      videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. You&apos;ll
      have all the Slurm you can drink when you&apos;re partying with Slurms McKenzie!
    </p>
    <p>
      I haven&apos;t felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. Oh, I think we should just stay
      friends. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Why, those are the
      Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! You&apos;ve
      killed me! Oh, you&apos;ve killed me! Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball&apos;s in
      Farnsworth&apos;s court! Michelle, I don&apos;t regret this, but I both rue and lament it.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, of course not. It was&mldr; uh&mldr; porno. Yeah, that&apos;s it. You&apos;ve killed me!
      Oh, you&apos;ve killed me! No argument here. No. We&apos;re on the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&apos;m sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed
      in. The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until
      you can make your bed in your sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, I&apos;m Santa Claus! WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! The alien mothership is
      in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of
      cards. Checkmate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn&apos;t make sense. But, okay! Okay, it&apos;s 500 dollars, you have
      no choice of carrier, the battery can&apos;t hold the charge and the reception isn&apos;t
      very&mldr; I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!
    </p>
    <p>
      Bender, being God isn&apos;t easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you
      do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a
      pickpocket. Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn&apos;t make sense. But, okay!
    </p>
    <p>
      Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Too much work. Let&apos;s burn it and say we dumped it
      in the sewer. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Well, let&apos;s just dump
      it in the sewer and say we delivered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      That&apos;s the ONLY thing about being a slave. Yeah, lots of people did. With gusto. Fatal.
      Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above
      you!
    </p>
    <p>
      You can crush me but you can&apos;t crush my spirit! Quite possible. We live long and are
      celebrated poopers. Son, as your lawyer, I declare y&apos;all are in a 12-piece bucket o&apos;
      trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin&apos; up that
      ol&apos; mess you caused.
